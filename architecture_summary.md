# Architecture Review Summary

## Best Practices Implemented:

### 1. **Joint Prior for Dual Property Conditioning** ✅
- Uses a SINGLE joint prior network `p(z|[logp, tpsa])` (not averaging separate priors)
- Input to prior: `[logp, tpsa]` concatenated as [B, 2]
- This is the mathematically correct CVAE approach

### 2. **Property Conditioning via Concatenation** ✅
- Properties concatenated with latent vector z: `[z, logp, tpsa]` → `[B, latent_dim+2]`
- Decoder receives conditioned z directly
- This is the standard CVAE best practice from research papers

### 3. **Property Normalization** ✅
- Zero mean, unit variance normalization for both properties
- Consistent normalization parameters saved/loaded with model
- Ensures equal contribution from LogP and TPSA

### 4. **KL Divergence** ✅
- CVAE KL: `KL(q(z|x) || p(z|[logp,tpsa]))`
- Numerically stable log-space computation
- Proper clipping to prevent NaN/Inf

### 5. **Property Prediction Loss** ✅
- Separate MSE losses for normalized LogP and TPSA
- Forces latent space to encode property information
- Normalized loss computation

## Architecture Components:

### Model Structure:
- **Encoder**: Transformer encoder (no property conditioning at input level)
- **Decoder**: Transformer decoder with `latent_dim+2` input dimension
- **Joint Prior**: Single network taking [logp, tpsa] → mu/logvar
- **Property Predictors**: LogP and TPSA prediction from latent z

### Training Flow:
1. Encode sequence → mu, logvar
2. Sample z from q(z|x)
3. Get joint prior: p(z|[logp,tpsa])
4. Compute KL: KL(q||p)
5. Concatenate z with [logp, tpsa] → z_conditioned
6. Decode z_conditioned → logits
7. Predict properties from z → property losses

### Inference Flow:
1. Normalize target properties
2. Sample z from joint prior p(z|[target_logp, target_tpsa])
3. Concatenate z with normalized properties
4. Autoregressive decoding with conditioned z

## Issues Found:

### 1. **Unused Code** ❌
- Property encoders (property_encoder_logp, property_encoder_tpsa) are defined but not used
- They create embeddings but these are never passed to anything
- This is dead code that should be removed

### 2. **Inconsistent Implementation** ❌
- Train step concatenates properties with z (lines 154-159)
- But also computes decoder_embedding (lines 105-121) which is never used
- Cleanup needed

## Recommended Actions:

1. **Remove unused property encoders** - They're not in the final architecture
2. **Remove decoder_embedding logic** - Properties are concatenated directly, not embedded
3. **Simplify code** - Remove all FILM-related logic since we're using concatenation

Current architecture is CORRECT and follows best practices, just has unused code.
